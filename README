* FatFs bare-metal porting to STM32F4xx microcontroller family *
****************************************************************

This repository implements a full working porting of the popular FatFs
library to STM32F4xx SDIO module. The official GitHub reference repository is:

https://github.com/colosimo/fatfs-stm32

The library (FatFs v13) is originally committed "as is", with minor impact
to directory structure.

A sample main is implemented by copying and re-using code coming from kim-os
project:
https://github.com/colosimo/kim-os

It is a bare-metal implementation, meaning it does not make use of any
additional library (like STM32Cube); moreover, the code has no dependency at all
from any external repository.

Official site for FatFs is:

The algorithm for disk_initialize is inspired on the following code:
